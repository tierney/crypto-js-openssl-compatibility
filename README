Provides C++ basics for generating AES blockciphered data that is compatible
with crypto-js.

Requires OpenSSL.

Build instructions:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    ./src/main "Message to encrypt"

Currently, the password is hard-coded as "Secret Passphrase." (Internally, the
OpenSSL libraries use a key derivation function based on the PKCSv1.5 standard
with an MD5 digest.)

In Crypto-JS, one can use the basic AES API to see the C++ code is compatible.

    <script src="http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js"></script>
    <script>
        var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt("Message", "Secret Passphrase");

        var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, "Secret Passphrase");
    </script>
