crypto-js-openssl-compatibility

Author: Matt Tierney

Provides C++ basics for generating AES blockciphered data that is compatible
with crypto-js.

Requires OpenSSL.

Build instructions:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    ./src/main "Message to encrypt"

Currently, the password is hard-coded as "Secret Passphrase." (Internally, the
OpenSSL libraries use a key derivation function based on the PKCSv1.5 standard
with an MD5 digest.)
